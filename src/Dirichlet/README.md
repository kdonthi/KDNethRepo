### Dirichlet .NET Number Theory Library

This is a fork of ricksladkey/Dirichlet with significant structural and code changes. Please refer to the original repo. This fork is work in progress and should not be considered stable or correct.

Dirichlet is an number theory library for .NET.

Features:

- Math and number theory operations for int, uint, long, ulong, Int128, UInt128, BigInteger, etc.
- High-performance Factorization
- Optimized Arithmetic Functions and Algorithms

Although it is fairly complete and well tested, it lacks the organization of a released library due to its evolution and the inclusion of various experimental ideas and highly-specialized applications.  In the algorithms in particular there are often many flavors of same thing in various attempts to increase performance.

If there is any interest, I might separate things out and migrate more of the core to [Dirichlet.Numerics](https://github.com/ricksladkey/dirichlet-numerics).
